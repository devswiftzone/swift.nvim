# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | ✅                 |
| tags    | Please upgrade     |

Only actively maintained branches receive security updates. Older tags may be
patched on a best-effort basis if the fix is low risk—otherwise please upgrade
to the latest `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Create a private advisory using GitHub's security portal:
   <https://github.com/devswiftzone/swift.nvim/security/advisories/new>.
2. Provide as much detail as possible—Neovim version, operating system, minimal
   reproduction steps, and potential impact.
3. Expect an initial acknowledgement within 3 business days. We will keep you
   informed about the remediation timeline and may request additional
   information if needed.

If you are unable to use GitHub's advisory workflow, contact the maintainers
through the GitHub support form and reference this repository.

## Preferred Disclosure Process

Once a fix is available, we plan to:

- Coordinate a release that includes the patch.
- Credit the reporter if they wish to be acknowledged.
- Disclose the details publicly after users have had a reasonable opportunity to
  update.

Thank you for helping keep swift.nvim and its users safe.
